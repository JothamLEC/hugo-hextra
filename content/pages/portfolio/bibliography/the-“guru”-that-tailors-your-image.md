“The suit makes the man,” as many tailors like to say. Many factors come into play when placing a price tag on a product. You need to consider the material costs, quality of workmanship, company upkeep, marketing and advertising, and so much more. In simpler terms, intrinsic value plays a key role in determining the price of a product. But that might not be the case for tailoring.

At any formal event, you will be greeted with a sea of jet black suits, coats, and jackets. But every so often, you will spot one or two spectacularly dressed gentlemen, in stark white, or striking red or blue. They stand out amongst the crowd. With a single glance, you will remember them for the rest of the evening, and sometimes, for future events as well.

To feel confident, to look your best at the best of times, to command attention and respect amongst your peers and industry leaders, how do you put a price tag on that?

“Your first impression is your last impression,” said our guest. “So make it count.”

This month, Entrepreneur Insight speaks with the director of Pinky Tailor’s Malaysia, simply known as Mr Guru, to talk about his passion and his interesting entrepreneurial journey transitioning from an IT desk job into the world of tailoring and textiles.

## Your Tailoring Skills. Are They Self-taught?

I have always had an interest in wearing smart, attractive clothes. But the skills in making them and tailoring them were actually identified by my uncle Mr Pinky, the man behind the Pinky Tailor’s brand.

Tailoring is actually a multi-generational business for us. My uncle opened his first tailoring store in 1980 in Bangkok, and the business has grown strong and lasted until today.

I used to travel all the way to Bangkok to get my suits done. One day Pinky pulled me aside and asked me, “Why don’t you try and join the business? It seems that you have the skills.” I had been considering joining the business for quite some time so I agreed and picked up these skills quickly. I think it’s because of the genes that run through the family.

So now here we are with the dream of Pinky Tailor’s Malaysia. I would have never thought that I would get into this business but we have been operating for about three and a half years now.

## What Was the Inspiration Behind Starting Your Own Tailoring Business?

I am actually an IT graduate and have about 20 years of IT experience under my belt. Working in the office, I see my colleagues, superiors, and clients wearing similar clothes from the same handful of branded retail stores. It gets boring to look at sometimes.

When you have done the same thing for almost two decades it loses its charm. At that point, I wanted to try something different or find a passion that I truly enjoyed. My mind and soul were telling me that I should venture into tailoring, not by force but by choice. I like dressing up, and I like dressing others as well.

The transition into running my own business is fairly funny I would say. Being an IT consultant and account manager, my work made me travel to many countries and work globally with clients. The experience dealing with and managing these clients actually translated very well into dealing with clients from my tailoring business. Tailoring is, after all, a service industry.

## How Has Fast Fashion Impacted the Tailoring Industry?

The fashion industry is a very broad one where the sky is the limit. In a broad industry, the customer is king. A strongly built young man would want a slim fit for a suit, but it may not look good on a sixty-year-old man. The fast fashion industry is built towards satisfying the broadest audience possible, meaning each piece of clothing does not exactly fit properly.

We look at age, height, body structure, demographic, and physical personality. There are many things to consider when tailoring a suit for a customer. Each suit is well customised and built for them, something fast fashion can’t provide. I believe tailoring will still have a place and audience in the industry.

## Is Pinky Tailors Malaysia Independent from the Original Bangkok Branch?

If I were to describe our relationship, the Bangkok branch is the heart of the business pumping blood here in Malaysia. Pinky is like a father and a valuable mentor. He made me who I am today, and whenever I need help he is just a phone call away.

That is why I chose to take the Pinky Tailor brand name instead of my own name. There are many clients who venture to Bangkok to get their suits done by my uncle; he is one of the best-recommended tailors in Bangkok. Now Malaysian clients come here to the shop to get their suits done without needing to fly to Bangkok themselves. The standards and expectations of the Pinky Tailor brand are already there, and I must not lower these standards. Social media is a very strong marketing tool nowadays; an angry customer’s complaint could tarnish everything. My uncle has established his brand over 45 years to where it is today. Upholding the Pinky brand name is the hardest challenge in running the business. The clients we get are extremely sensitive to the quality of work.

## What Are General Misconceptions towards Tailoring that You Normally Encounter?

I do not understand but almost everyone asks for the same colour - black. In fact, most of my clients just want to buy a black coat either from a store or tailor. I am not a fan of black. If the client’s company does not have a strict dress code for colours, I would almost always recommend going for something more vibrant. Why not try something different?

## Something that You Could Not Get Elsewhere from Any Other Generic Store?

You have the option to pick from hundreds of different fabrics, all with unique patterns and colours. I am not asking you to wear a bright green coat which can be an eyesore. But try something nicer for office business wear, not something every Tom, Dick, and Harry is wearing in town.
I do wish my clients would wear a well-tailored suit but feel they wasted money on the investment they made just because it makes them look like everybody else.

## You Sing Praises of the Pinky Tailor Brand. What Defines that Brand?

First off, I would like to stress our selection of fabric. We do not allow any cheap fabric to enter our store, both in Bangkok and here. We handpick our fabrics carefully and turn away suppliers who offer us cheap products. This means the quality of our fabric is assured even at the lowest price starting range.

All our fabrics are pure wool or wool blend. I am proud to display pure Italian fabrics - Lanificio Cerruti, Zinnia, Holland & Sherry, and many more in the shop. These fabrics are essentially the Mercedes of the textile industry; they produce really great suits.

Our attention to detail is also what defines the Pinky brand. We bring a certain air of uniqueness to the product, even if it is a small thing. Some details, even buttonholes, personalise them. Something as simple as changing the colours of buttons adds a lot of value to the finished garment.

## What Advice Would You Give Aspiring Tailors?

Having “The Eye” is important in becoming a tailor. When a client comes with zero knowledge of how a proper suit should look and feel like, you are responsible for educating and guiding them through the process. It is your responsibility to envision how he will look in the end and what looks best on him. Hence, “The Eye”. Not just for aspiring tailors, but for myself as well. We all know how much work is needed to establish the Pinky brand in Malaysia so everyone ends up buying custom-tailored suits and inquiring about Pinky’s Malaysia beforehand.
