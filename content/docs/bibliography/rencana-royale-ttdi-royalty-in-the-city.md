“Land is finite.“

That fact alone is what makes real estate such a powerful investment tool, driving up prices year after year. It is a basic human need to have a roof above our heads, a basic necessity to be exact. Hence, why real estate is a tried and proven asset to safeguard your nett worth, while generating passive income.

While land is finite, not all land is created equal. More can be said about the land located in Taman Tun Dr Ismail (TTDI). With its matured neighbourhood, easy access to public transport, healthy population, stable rental rates and limited land, TTDI is probably the prime area to look out for when it comes to investment or even for your own use.

Amongst all the options available in the prestigious address, it is hard to ignore the latest offering by the award-winning developer CK East Group - Rencana Royale.

Rencana Royale is primed to be one of the highlights in the township, consisting of two towers with 13 floors each, totalling 622 units. The project is built on Malay reserved land with freehold status, under a commercial title. With a relatively low density, owners are able to appreciate better security, easier access to facilities, and overall peace of mind.

Rencana Royale is strategically located, with near-direct connectivity to Kuala Lumpur using the Penchala Link tunnel via the SPRINT Expressway, and to the south via the Damansara-Puchong Expressway (LDP). Not to mention, demand for the project may appreciate in the coming years, with the expected completion of the DASH highway by mid-2020.

Benefits of purchasing Rencana Royale is not limited to just easy connectivity. The location also provides easy access to commercial areas such as One Utama shopping centre, IKEA and The Curve district, and office buildings located within Damansara Perdana.

For those who are commuting to and from Kuala Lumpur or Petaling Jaya,

owners would be glad to know that access to public transport would be a breeze, thanks to the nearby TTDI MRT station.

A QUICK LOOK ON THE INSIDE The external facts do look great on paper, but the fine details of the interior of the project are what attracts both investors and would-be buyers. This is where Rencana Royale truly shines.

Rencana Royale features both Executive Suite and Deluxe Suite options, both come with a single-storey or duplex variant, offering much-needed flexibility in terms of space and design. Unit sizes range from 472 sq ft to 1,841 sq ft.

But I would like to bring more attention

to the three-storey Sky Suites that do provide several options that are unique in this marketplace. With only 16 units total available, these suites are essentially threestoreyed properties perched on rooftops.

With two variants aptly named “The Duke” and “The Duchess”, the former has a built-up unit size of 4,813 sq ft, and the latter has a built-up unit size of 3,798 sq ft. Owners will also have the exclusivity of having their own private lift within their units, and a private lift lobby from the carpark basement to the 13th floor where the suites are located.

Each unit features its own garden area, spacious balcony and an expansive, multiusage indoor and outdoor space. Every room in both variants of the Sky Suites sports a private restroom with bathtub as well. The entire floor features a dedicated safety and security system ensure the safety of the occupants inside.

Speaking of which, this unit is perfect for wealthy individuals, or more specifically, busy businessmen who commute outstation often. The safety of these Sky Suites is comparable, if not more secure, than landed bungalows due to the inaccessibility of not being on the ground floor, and the extended layers of security. Owners can rest assure that the unit’s occupants are in safer hands while they are away.

## WHAT ABOUT THE FACILITIES?

The exterior of this project certainly doesn’t disappoint. Rencana Royale is outfitted with two facility floors, boasting an infinity sky pool, swimming pool and jacuzzi surrounded by a manicured landscape, a cafe, a recreational park and a BBQ area; these facilities are perfect for social and gatherings.

A strong community is the core of the Rencana Royale lifestyle; hence the deck is also outfitted with a conference room, cinema hall, grand meeting room, meeting room and multipurpose hall, where owners are able to hold both private and community events.

With all of these talks on great locations and attractive features, one might assume that the pricing of Rencana Royale would be the bottleneck for this project.

Investors would be glad to know that pricing is actually not just reasonable, but highly attractive. Prices start around the RM350,000 ballpark for the standard suites, which is almost unheard of amongst new development projects, considering the location and the features offered by the developers.

Rencana Royale might prove to be a very attractive investment tool, both financially as well as the inherent value provided by the facilities, services and location of the project.

CK East Group has really outdone themselves this time around. Whether you are working both in Petaling Jaya or Kuala Lumpur, Rencana Royale is the project worthy of your consideration if you appreciate owning a property in an affluent part of the city, all while keeping your personal finances safe and happy.
