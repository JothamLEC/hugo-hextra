Imagine if you are running a multinational corporation, and you have bought Office Tower A and B of a stratified mixed-development. However, your maintenance fees and service charges may be determined by the multiple individual owners of Tower C.

What’s also strange is that all the best facilities, such as the gym and multimedia halls, are located in Tower C which you have limited, or no access to. How can this happen?

There are many factors involved that have resulted in such a situation, but there is no doubt that governmental policies leave a significant impact on this equation. Today, we explore the idea of equal representation amongst parcel owners, or more specifically, the lack thereof.

The Strata Management Act 2013, simply known as Act757, is enacted to handle all things strata-related, from the application process, collecting default payments, and handover from the developer, amongst many other things.

Gazetted in 2013, the act combines three acts into one, namely: 1. The Building And Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act 2007 (Act 663), 2. The Strata Titles Act 1985 (Act 318) 3. Part Of The Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 (Act 118)

Lawyer Lum Youk Lee of the Research Committee Malaysia Shopping Mall Association (PPKM) shared, in a strata management seminar, that the history of the strata laws act like a pendulum when it comes to unfair representation.

Prior to Act 757, the allocation of shared units is heavily dependent on the developers’ directive, causing uneasiness amongst minority voters within the Joint Management Body (JMB) and Management Corporation (MC). However, with the enactment of Act 757, he claims that the pendulum is now slowly shifting towards the other end, favouring individual parcel owners instead.

The case is best exemplified with commonly cited court cases such as Ideal Advantage Sdn Bhd v Palm Spring JMB & Anor (2014), where it is possible for private areas to be converted to common areas regardless of the arrangements made prior to Act757. “If you own 200 carparks today, tomorrow when you wake

up, it might have become a common area,” said Lum.

With the way the shared unit is

calculated and maximum voting rights capped at 49%, en bloc parcel owners are the ones at a loss here. “Those who are most affected by these are the realestate-investment-trusts (REIT). They have voluntarily or involuntarily inherited large amounts of retail space that they have no full control over,” said Lum.

He gave examples of major mall acquisitions in the past ten years, such as Mayland Properties’ acquisition of Phoenix Plaza. They have injected RM159 million to have a makeover and revived the mall into the Cheras Sentral we see today. However, there are many cases of individual parcel owners suing these major stakeholders for not complying with the strict renovation policies stated in the act.

“The law is moving away, and punishing owners that hold a majority stake of a strata property. Lawmakers are caught up with the ‘fairness’ that they have not yet considered the business viability of things,” said Lum.

“The problem right now is that all different types of properties, from mixed commercial developments, to serviced apartments are all governed under the same act. The same piece of legislation is handling the capital expenses of a low-cost flat to the refurbishment of a large shopping complex, and this has caused many disparities between all parties,” he added.

One of the more groundbreaking court cases has just happened recently, in the case of Muhamad Nazri Bin Muhamad v JMB Menara Rajawali and Denflow Sdn Bhd (2018).

Menara Rajawali consists of residential, retail and car park parcels. In an annual general meeting (AGM), the JMC has fixed multiple rates of charges as below: a. residential parcels–RM3.26 per share unit b. retail shop parcels–RM3.26 per share unit c. car park parcel–RM1.68 per share unit

The plaintiff argues that the multiple rates imposed are invalid, citing clauses in Act757. However, the court ruled in favour of the defendant and state that nothing in Act 757 prevents JMB/JMC from fixing different rates of charges for different types of units in a stratified project.

The reason why this court case is groundbreaking is that it is now legally possible for individual parcel owners to impose different maintenance fee rates on en-bloc parcel owners, i.e. REITs, developers, investors, as long as it is approved in a general meeting.

In layman terms, private owners can band together and force corporations or wealthy individuals to pay a more substantial portion of the maintenance fees to the private owners’ own benefit, if they so wish.

There is one very straightforward solution that is able to circumvent most of the issues that have surfaced from Act757the formation of sub-management corporations, or sub-MCs. In a standard mixed development project, sub-MCs allow the residential portion and the commercial

portion to form their own respective committees, and manage their side of the property without encroaching on the other party’s jurisdiction.

Sub-MCs can help protect each party’s interest and makes conflict resolution much more manageable. The Act itself allows the formation of sub-MCs, and yet, there is only one legally recognised sub-MC in the entirety of Malaysia, which is 1 Mont’ Kiara.

Lawyer Sarita Ashok Khandhar, managing partner of Edorra Arfah Khandhar, explained to Property Insight that it is extremely difficult to form subMCs. “To form a sub-MC, the developer has to go through the standard process of handing it over to the JMB, and then to the MCs,” said Sarita.

“They then have to secure a land surveyor and experts, approach multiple governmental bodies to get the proper documentation. But the biggest roadblock of all, is to secure a two-thirds majority vote within the MC, which is extremely difficult to pull off in the first place,” she further explained.

One of the suggested amendments to Act 757 is to allow for the formation of sub-MCs during the “shared unit formula stage (SiFUS)”, which is early in the project development process. Every stakeholder that Property Insight has approached so far is supportive of this idea, and the formation of sub-MCs in general.

“Forming sub-MCs in the SiFUS stage is good. In fact, we are looking to apply and implement sub-MCs in our latest project - Dorsett Waterfront Subang, because there is a hotel element in our mixed development project. A developer with a team of consultants is much better qualified to deal with the division of the special parcels needed to form sub-MCs,” said Datuk Kevin Woo, managing director of Malaysia Land Properties Sdn Bhd (Mayland).

“Sub-MCs is something that all developers would like to have, especially if it involves commercial segments. Normal JMBs don’t really know how to manage the commercial properties,” said Danny Koek, managing director of DK Group.

“For a shopping mall, you may need a chargeman, and a lot of professional knowledge to manage it. Unless the commercial owners own a large portion of the project, it is difficult to form sub-MCs, because the share unit may not be enough,” he added.

“(For these reasons), we try not to acquire stratified properties. Even if we did, we would prefer to own a majority stake in it, maybe about 90%. We will make it extremely clear in the contract, the details and the boundaries of all the parties involved,” said Leong Kit May, Chief Executive Officer of

“When we talk about sub-MCs, we are talking about common space. That is why it is important to properly design the project in the early stages, to have a proper separation between the various components. That is why in our ‘8th & Stellar’ project, each component has its own dedicated lifts and their own parking,” said Yeo Chun Sing, managing director of Chin Hin Group.

A carefully, well-drafted policy is filled with compromises. Key stakeholders need to have multiple discussions in order to come to a unanimous conclusion that everyone is satisfied with. Despite all the compromises involved, there will still be winners and losers in the equation.

Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws. But at the end of the day, no human is above the law, and no human is below it either.

Sub-MCs is a policy that serves to ground the pendulum towards the centre, but it needs to be given more weight in order to be proven effective.
