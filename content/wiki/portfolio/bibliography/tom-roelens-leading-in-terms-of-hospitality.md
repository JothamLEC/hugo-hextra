## Bringing The Four Seasons to Malaysia’s Ever Summer

**By: Jotham Lim**

Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur took centre stage when it opened its doors to the public last November. The 65-storey Four Seasons Hotel is the latest luxury hotel to dot the cosmopolitan skyline here in Kuala Lumpur, located at Jalan Ampang just adjacent to the Petronas Twin Towers.

Ever since its launch, customers have been singing nothing but praises of their stay in the world-famous hotel. The Four Seasons brand has always been associated with quality service, elegant designs and a comfortable stay, and the Kuala Lumpur branch certainly did not disappoint.

Running a business is never easy, but here at _Entrepreneur Insight_, we are not just about all work and no fun. We decided to forego the strict business formalities for once and take a much light-hearted approach with Tom Roelens, the General Manager of Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur, and ask him about his stay in Malaysia and his management style. Tom hails from Belgium, and we were curious to see Malaysia from his perspective and how much it differs from our own perception.

### Tell Us a Little about Your Previous Postings with Four Seasons, and Which Posting Left the Most Significant Impression on You and why

Each of the postings has been varied and in wonderful destinations. I thoroughly enjoyed Jakarta and lived in Indonesia for six years between Bali and Jakarta. Newport Beach, Southern California is an excellent part of the world, and diving in the Maldives is unequalled. After opening the Four Seasons Maldives, I moved to the private island of Lana’i in Hawaii, which truly is Hawaii as it was intended to be. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to live and work in places where many dream of visiting once in their lifetime.

### Is This Your First time in Malaysia? How Has the Malaysian Experience Differed from other Postings?

This is my first time actually working in Malaysia. I had been here a few times before, albeit a number of years ago. I am quite familiar with working in South East Asia, having lived and worked in Jakarta and Bali for a few years. Working in Asia is particularly exceptional, and I love the different cultures we have here.

### What Do You Personally Enjoy Most about Malaysia so Far?

There is a reason Malaysians love their food; it is truly amazing. I enjoy and appreciate the different cultures, fantastic festivals, and the wide variety of food options.

### Any Thoughts You Would like to Share about the Grand Opening of Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur?

The Four Seasons Hotel launched in July 2018, and the Grand Opening was celebrated in November 2018. It was indeed a night to remember. The opening was officiated by His Royal Highness Sultan of Selangor Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah Al-Haj, with the guest of honour being the Acting King, His Royal Highness Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah. Raja Muda Selangor Tengku Amir Shah and the Minister of Economic Affairs YB Dato’ Seri Azmin Ali, as well as the Minister of Federal Territories, were also present to witness the Grand Opening.

### The Four Seasons Brand is Internationally Known and Acclaimed. What Would You Say to Someone to Sell Them on Staying at This Particular Hotel?

I believe the exceptional service that our team provides makes the brand exceptional. Our company is a people-oriented company, and our people drive the product and service to be the best.

### Tell Us a Little More about the F&B Offerings at FS Hotel KL. What Would You Say is an Absolute Must-try?

At FS KL, we have four restaurants and two bars. Each outlet has a strong identity and concept, with talented chefs offering exceptional cuisines. Yun House, one of the most appreciated restaurants in town, introduces a modern approach to timeless dining and serves the finest Chinese delicacies with a strong influence from Cantonese cuisine. The signature spread includes sumptuous dim sum. Curate is a phenomenal buffet restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Lounge offers an excellent afternoon tea as well as an à la carte menu with Western and local dishes throughout the day.

### Tell Us a Little Bit about the Hiring Process. In Your Opinion, what Are the Most Important Traits an Employee in the Hospitality line Must Have?

For the industry, being passionate and hospitable are key. As a people-oriented company, we believe in developing employees who have the right attitude and willingness to learn and grow.

### What Qualities Do You Look for in Hotel Staff, and what Sets Them apart from Staff at other Hotels?

Our team members are always delivering above and beyond service, willing to go the extra mile to make each guest happy and leave with fond memories.

### How Would You Describe Your Management Style, and what Traits Have You Learnt across Your Career that You Deem Most Important for Success?

I believe in trusting the team to provide exceptional service to guests every day. I support the team and provide the tools for them to be the best in their respective roles.

### You’ve Talked about Your Ambitions to Make FS Hotel KL the Standard in the Hospitality Industry. What Challenges Do You Face in Achieving This Goal, and what Plans Have You Laid out to Achieve It?

Kuala Lumpur’s skyline is changing rapidly, with newly opened hotels and many more in the pipeline. With our unique offerings, the largest guest rooms in town, great suites, luxury serviced apartments, beautiful restaurants, bars, and exceptional service, I am confident in our future of establishing a foothold in the industry.

### The Hospitality Industry is in a Tight Spot with the Rise of Short-term Rentals like Airbnb. With This Continuing Trend, what Do Hotels Need to Offer as a Value Proposition to Compete with the Relatively Lower Prices that Short-term Rentals Offer?

Other means of accommodation will always attract in terms of price point. We offer ultra-luxurious hospitality that no other place can. Our guests know and trust the hospitality that we provide, and that’s what keeps them coming back.

### What Does the Perfect Hotel Look Like?

The perfect hotel should be buzzing with an abundant supply of happy, smiling guests. We are in the business of making memories and creating exceptional experiences for our guests.

### Tell Us a Little Bit about Yourself. What Hobbies Have You Picked up since Arriving Here?

I very much enjoy regular early morning runs in KL. During my free time, I explore ethnic restaurants and catch up on new spots in town. I love travelling and have visited Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Penang, and Malacca.

### Do You Have a Favourite Local Dish Yet?

I am in an eternal search for the best banana leaf in town!

### A Little-known Piece of Trivia: You First Started in Hospitality as a Chef! What is a Simple Belgian Speciality You Can Cook to Give Us a Taste of Belgian Cuisine?

Belgian mussels are always a favourite, and Belgian Fries are a must.
