MHub, Malaysia’s leading digital real estate marketplace, has signed a partnership agreement with Juwai.com, China’s largest international property online website, to attract overseas Chinese buyers looking to purchase properties in Malaysia today.

The agreement will provide local property sellers access to Juwai.com’s more than 3.1 million monthly active users. According to Juwai.com, buyers from mainland China had purchased RM 9.5 billion worth of Malaysian residential and commercial properties last year, with more than 80% of the investment allocated towards the residential sector.

“Enquiries towards Malaysian properties has increased six-fold for the last two years. This is partially due to Malaysia’s good infrastructure, legal system for foreign home purchases, reputable developers and affordability by international standards,” said Georg Chmiel, Chairman of the Board of Juwai.com

Following the trend, Chinese investment in the Malaysian residential market is expected to double by the year 2025.

“It is an exciting time ahead for the Malaysian and Chinese property sectors. The alliance of MHub and Juwai.com aims to expand the addressable market for property sellers in Malaysia. Our property tech platform brings the ecosystem of developers, agents, bankers, lawyers and buyers under one roof, to enable faster, simpler and safer property sales transaction.” said Mr Quek Wee Siong,  Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mhub.
