**Device Picks & Tips By: Jotham Lim**

When will we ever start to conserve energy? The polar ice caps are melting, global warming is in effect, and species are going extinct at an unprecedented rate. However, nothing motivates us better to save and conserve energy more than our monthly electricity bill. Realistically speaking, energy efficiency is not top among the list of priorities we have as homeowners. But it is definitely a cost saver, so why not save our planet while we’re at it?

We assume that you, as a first-time homebuyer, may have already spent an absurd amount of money on a brand new home. So, in addition to energy saving, we have factored in product affordability and reliability as well, just to bring you the editorial picks for 10 energy (and cost) saving devices on the market.

## Solar Panels? Or Not?

Why pay for electricity at all when you can generate your own? A home powered by solar energy is the obvious first choice when it comes to saving electricity. However, installing an entire solar ecosystem can be very expensive, and it costs about RM45,000 for a standard rooftop.

However, assuming that your general monthly energy consumption is about RM600-900, you can get your return on investment in 5 years. Plus, the government has introduced a solar leasing programme under the Supply Agreement for Renewable Energy (SARE) programme where buyers can “buy solar panels as if you’re buying a phone plan”.

Another point to consider is that you can actually sell off excess solar energy back to TNB. Thanks to the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) and its Feed-In Tariff (FiT) programme, you can sell electricity to TNB at the same rate TNB is charging its consumers.

With so many factors involved, we still recommend that readers consult a professional to determine if solar-powered energy is the right fit for your home.

## Air Conditioner - LG 1.0HP Dual Inverter Deluxe

Air-conditioners are one of the highest energy consumption devices in the household. However, LG’s 5-star ratings for energy efficiency are not just for show. LG claims that its Dual Inverter Compressor will cool faster, last longer, and run quieter, not to mention save energy by up to 70%.

LG has so much confidence in its products that the device is provided with a 10-year warranty on the compressor. It also comes with an auto-clean function, and its trademarked Gold Fin technology provides corrosion resistance to the product.

For energy consumption, we have to give this spot to LG as your cheap and effective solution to beat Malaysia’s perpetual summer.

## Standing Fan - Midea MF-16FS15F

We can’t rely on air conditioners 24/7. That would somewhat defeat the purpose of this entire article, wouldn’t it? This is where standing fans come into play.

The MIDEA MF-16FS15F is probably a property investor’s crowd favourite. It is cheap, effective, and easily transportable from one property to another. It comes with an ABS Fan Blade design for better airflow control and has a 5-star rating with an average consumption of 60 Kwh/year.

A standing fan is an excellent option for budget-friendly households or a cheap way to furnish a rental home without putting a massive dent in your pocket.

## Ceiling Fan - Panasonic Econavi 4 Blades

If standing fans take up too much space or maybe you need a slight upgrade in quality of life, a good quality ceiling fan may be your saviour.

The Panasonic Econavi 4 Blades is the cheapest DC motor ceiling fan we surveyed so far. A DC motor is essential for effective power management, using low power for maximum output. At only 240 mm tall, this fan is perfect for rooms with low ceiling height.

The fan also features Econavi technology, which has an intelligent temperature sensor that adjusts air velocity according to room temperature. No more fiddling around with the remote control every now and then.

## Water Heater - Joven i90P

A warm shower is a great way to start your morning, but being electrocuted midway through is not. The i90P comes with an EELS system and surge protector to provide barrier protection against any unwanted accidents in the shower. Like all devices, an inverter DC input is the only way to go in order to save electricity costs. Thankfully, the i-series from Joven features an inverter DC pump specifically designed for optimum usage. We decided to depend on the i90P as our go-to model for its best design, abundant features, and most importantly, great value for money.

## Refrigerator - LG IEC GR-QS333L

There are plenty of reasons to love this refrigerator model. A 333-litre fridge well suited for a family of five comes with a decent price tag. With trademarked LinearCooling technology, the compressor uses fewer components than a standard compressor system, significantly reducing energy loss in the process. This model also features DoorCooling+ technology, which claims to cool the interior quicker than conventional refrigerators. It’s an investor’s go-to investment option when it comes to furnishing any form of rental.

## Washing Machine - LG T2109VS2M

An average household uses 5-6 loads of laundry per week, and an average washing machine lasts approximately 10 years. A washing machine would probably outlast most electronic appliances in a household, so it’s worth putting in the extra to acquire a decent quality one.

The LG T2109VS2M is a top-loading 9 kg capacity washing machine outfitted with the latest Smart Inverter Technology, allowing for more efficient cleaning. Its standby power feature ensures minimal electricity is being used while the device is plugged in, even when not in use.

## Lighting - Philips

When it comes to lighting solutions for home usage, you can never go wrong with LED. Over the course of 50,000 hours, LED light bulbs trump other forms of lighting in terms of saving costs. Due to different specifications, we couldn’t recommend a single lighting fixture for a specific home. However, we picked the Philips brand over others due to its wide range of products and reliability in terms of Colour Rendering Indexes and product lifespan. You can never go wrong with Philips. With the launch of the new HUE lineup, users are able to customise their lighting setup with a single flick on their smartphone. The cost to install quality LED lights may be high upfront, but the returns on savings are unbeatable in the long run.

## Television - Sony XF75F

OLED TVs took the entire market by storm when they were first introduced. Their vibrant colours, gorgeous displays, and deep blacks made their way into the hearts of consumers. However, did you know OLED consumes twice the amount of power than LED? Not to mention the exorbitant price tag that goes along with it. Sometimes, you don’t need the latest and greatest; you need something good enough. The Sony XF75F LED TV is the best bang for your buck in terms of budget and value. You get a return on features such as a 43-inch HDR display, SMART TV Android functionality, and more. With ClearAudio+ technology, you won’t need to spend extra cash on a high-grade sound system either.

## Intuitive Home Design

Sometimes, changing electrical devices alone just couldn’t cut it. To fully optimise your setup, smart and efficient designs come into play. Many old and new developments have specially located water tank placements that naturally warm water through sunlight alone, negating the need for water heaters during the daytime. Some contractors offer building envelope sealing solutions to prevent cold air from escaping to the outside environment. These are some examples of reducing and reusing through smart designs within the household. It is recommended to consult a proper interior designer to determine what solutions are best for your personal needs.

### Reducing Human Error

At the end of the day, nothing saves more utility costs than cold-hard discipline and constant monitoring. Even something rudimentary like turning off all devices after use and unplugging them from the wall outlet is hard to enforce long-term. Sometimes it’s not practical to expend the time and effort to do so, which is perfectly understandable. At the very least, turning off lights, fans, and air conditioners before leaving a room works wonders. Compounded, these cost-saving measures slowly but surely add up.

### Conclusion

Be clear about your objectives and decide why you want to cut down on usage. Is it to save the planet or to reduce utility costs? Regardless, thinking that saving is a luxury only the rich and wealthy can afford is hugely misleading. Every one of us can play a role in reducing our carbon footprint. The real question everyone should be asking is how saving fits into their list of priorities. The answer to that will determine the actions and purchasing decisions in the end.
