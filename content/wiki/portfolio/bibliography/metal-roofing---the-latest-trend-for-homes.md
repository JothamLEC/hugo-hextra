There have been leaps and bounds in the advancement of building and construction techniques in recent years, making it fairly hard to keep track of all the latest technological developments in the sector. However, today we will tackle a topic that has not been given the attention it deserves: roofing solutions and how much of a role they play in energy conservation efforts.

The editorial team at Property Insight had the opportunity to chat with renowned architect, Dato’ Kiat Tung from T&T Architect, to get his professional insights on this topic. Dato’ Kiat has decades of experience working on both commercial and residential projects. His portfolio includes many development projects from big-name developers such as EcoWorld, SP Setia, and Gamuda. If you have recently bought properties from these developers, it has most likely been given the magic touch from Dato’ Kiat.

## From Your Personal Experience, how much of a Priority Do Homeowners place on Energy Conservation?

It is sad to say, but eco-friendliness is not at the top of the list for residential buyers. More important factors play a more prominent role in influencing a buyer’s purchasing decision, like location, pricing, and rental rates. Moreover, solar installations are not much more beneficial to homeowners with landed properties as opposed to high-rise projects. In addition to the relatively cheap cost of energy here in Malaysia, it is understandable why energy conservation is not given the level of attention it needs in the residential sector.

However, the opposite is true for commercial properties. For commercial spaces like office complexes and shopping malls, energy upkeep costs can inflate to absurdly high numbers, and businesses are much more incentivised to search for greener solutions to reduce their upkeep costs. For certain multi-national corporations, energy conservation is also baked into the ISO requirements, making energy conservation a must.

## For Roofing Solutions, what Are the Options Currently Available on the Market, and how Do They Compare?

For roofing materials, there are too many options available to list. But for the sake of simplicity, the commonly used ones on the market are Reinforced Concrete Flat Roof (RC flat roof) and steel/metal roofing.

RC flat roof has always been the traditional option, and it is the most widely used roofing solution here in Malaysia. However, there has been a rising trend of using metal roofing as a modern alternative to RC flat roofs. From my personal working experience, I would say about 30% of current projects have resorted to using metal roofs, and there are plenty of reasons for them to do so.

Traditional RC flat roofs need additional waterproofing treatments, but most waterproofing solutions have a limited lifespan. Having a metal roof is one of the solutions to this problem. Metal roofing is also fairly durable, easy to install, and great for security. Whenever we mention metal or steel roofing, people tend to picture cheap, low-grade zinc roofing used in low-cost dwellings. However, there are plenty of creative ways you can play around with the material to make it aesthetically pleasing.

Metal roofs have the unique ability to achieve a very low pitch, making them look almost flat. Moreover, there has been a shift in building techniques in recent years. Many developers are now adopting the Industrialised Building System (IBS), whereby construction materials are transported pre-installed and are outfitted as is. Metal roofs fit perfectly in the pipeline, as they are prefabricated in the factory and are less labour intensive to install.

This is in comparison to concrete roofing, which finds itself hard to adapt to this new construction workflow, as concrete is generally cured and hardened on the spot.

## It Seems that You Have an Immense Interest in Metal Roofing. Care to Share More?

I would like to put forth a disclaimer and say that no material is perfect, and each material has its place in every design concept. Even for something as simple as metal roofing, there is a wide array of different grades of the same product to suit various price ranges. There are also inferior metal roofing options on the market that rust easily within a short span of time and don’t have the proper coatings.

The biggest downsides to using metal roofing would be its insulation and acoustics. However, these problems can be easily solved using proper insulation and soundproofing techniques. Workmanship is also another essential factor to consider. Metal roofing is a great material against leakage, but it may occur from time to time due to bad workmanship or a really low pitch design.

Currently, more and more house designs are moving towards modern architecture, hence we are inclined towards using metal roofs. As architects, we also encourage diversity in our selection of materials. Metal roofing, I would say, is a modern aesthetic, and I like to mix and match different roofing materials to give the project a unique and diverse look that is hard to emulate elsewhere.

## It is Said that Metal Roofing is an Excellent Option for Energy Conservation. Can You Please Elaborate More on That?

Metal roofing, in general, is much more eco-friendly than traditional forms of materials such as concrete and shingles. The reason being that metal is a highly recyclable material, which is great for reducing our carbon footprint.

There are plenty of metal roofs on the market that are made out of recycled materials. Metal roofing is also less wasteful when compared to other types of materials, as scraps can be easily melted down to produce even more roofing material.

Metal roofing by itself is also recyclable. For old or abandoned projects looking to be demolished, instead of throwing the roofing along with the rest of the rubble, the metal roofing can be recycled for other newer projects on the market. Although the simple switch in material usage for roofing may not seem like much, the benefits do add up and compound in the long run. Until the day comes when concrete is recyclable, it is hard to beat metal roofing in the eco-friendliness department.

## There Are Plenty of Metal Roofing Options Available on the Market. How Do You Pick and Select the Type of Metal Roofing Used on Your Projects?

I have been exploring COLORBOND®, a product by BlueScope, as it is a good roofing choice due to its durability and resistance to staining. If the client has no particular preference, COLORBOND® has always been a safe go-to solution for roofing for many of my projects.

I would also like to highlight that it is important to insulate the metal roof properly as the majority of heat in a property is transmitted via the roof. Proper insulation will provide a much cooler environment, which will also reduce energy consumption.

Speaking of which, COLORBOND® provides high thermal efficiency as well. With the correct colour combination, it can reflect solar heat during bright sunny days, reducing the need to keep air-conditioning running at full blast.

## Any Final Thoughts You Would like to Share in regards to Roofing Solutions?

I would like to share that as an architect, picking out the right roofing material is an immensely stressful decision, even more so than designing window locations. Yes, window placement does play a significant role in every construction project and is highly dependent on the direction of the wind. However, the roof remains the most prominent factor when it comes to energy conservation. It protects us from the harshest elements. If for any reason you decide to change up your current roof design, if the opportunity presents itself, why not give metal roofing a try?
