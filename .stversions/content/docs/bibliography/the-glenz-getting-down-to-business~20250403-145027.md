# The Glenz Getting Down to Business

_A premium address for business and leisure at a great value._

By: Jotham Lim

Sitting snugly in the suburban environment within the Shah Alam district, Glenmarie is renowned for its Hicom-Glenmarie Industrial Park, a central industrial and commercial hub in the region.

However, the low-rise commercial and light industrial buildings will soon give way to The Glenz, a 22-storey central business hub developed by SG. Besi Construction Sdn Bhd (SBC). Hotels, Offices, Leisure and Retail, this all-in-one cohesive development is aimed at becoming the new central business hub for Glenmarie, literally transforming the landscape of the entire region.

The Glenz will be SBC’s largest undertaking, but they are no strangers to property development. The company hails from a construction background, famous for its Coca Cola project in Bandar Enstek with its RM100 million contract.

The Glenz sits on top of a 2.5-acre freehold land, with the upcoming LRT3 Kerjaya Station a short distance away, which is scheduled for trial operations by the year 2023.

Comprising 416 office suites, eight 4-storey shop lots and a 130-room hotel, The Glenz provides purchasers with a wide array of options in terms of space, from the Type-G office and designer’s suite with just 485 sq ft to the Type H which sports an 11,173 sq ft layout, perfect for most small-medium enterprises (SMEs).

The retail outlets on the lower floors can even go up to 5,482 sq ft for the Type D2 layout. SBC has also allocated 12,900 sq ft of anchor tenant space, suitable for a supermarket or restaurant.

Property Insight has reached out to SBC’s Managing Director, Mr Fong Sui Leong, to get his thoughts on the project.

## What is the Initial Concept or Story behind The Glenz?

We have an excellent location and close proximity to the proposed LRT3 Kerjaya Station and we would like to leverage that heavily. At first, we initially thought of just developing a medium-grade plain commercial office.

However, we found that there is a broader market for a mid-sized integrated commercial project to suit the modern working lifestyle. I have confidence that there will be a stream of business activities flowing through this area.

## Why Glenmarie of All Places?

Glenmarie has already established itself as a commercial hub that houses hundreds of major branded SME establishments. It is also a central location for automobile showrooms and service centres, not to mention a nearby exclusive residential enclave - Glenmarie Residences.

What the district lacks is the support of a business and leisure facility that offers offices, hotels and entertainment. The Glenz aims to fill that gap in the market.

## What Makes The Glenz Stand Out Amongst the Rest of the Properties in the Nearby Area?

I believe that our location speaks for itself. Having an LRT3 station right at our doorstep, and being well connected to all major commercial areas, stretching from Johan Setia in Klang to Bandar Utama in Damansara, provides us with an edge over the market.

Even without the proposed LRT3 station, The Glenz is already easily accessible via the existing public transport network, with the nearby Batu Tiga KTM Station and Subang Jaya LRT Station.

## However, while Others See Challenges, I See Opportunities

However, having the right location is just part of the equation. Having the right product to cater to the right audience is important as well. The Glenz is the only integrated commercial development project in the area, comprising designer’s office suites, shopping facilities and a hotel.

Our office suites have a North-South orientation which serves to provide shade from our harsh Malaysian sunlight. We have a modern landscape to greet you as you enter and exit the building. We have even planned for a swimming pool and gymnasium dedicated to tenants, to cater to the modern working lifestyle. All of these are packaged nicely in a well-designed and aesthetically pleasing facade.

For those who prefer to drive, we have more than 1,100 car park lots for both tenants and visitors, including a special parking zone on the lower ground floor for the convenience of shoppers.

We are also dedicated to providing the best for our clients’ business needs and to advancing our green and sustainability efforts. We have an extensive security system, Fibre Optic Broadband infrastructure, energy-saving LED light fixtures, and hybrid and electric vehicle charging ports.

## Who Are Your Target Customers? How Does This Project Specially Cater To This Demographic?

Our target customers are SMEs operating in and around Glenmarie who need a commercial office suite to manage their regional businesses from. It serves as a great corporate headquarters as there are plenty of facilities that can accommodate and entertain their guests and associates. In fact, there is no existing business-class hotel in the area.

Our mixed commercial development project is designed to meet these needs. Entrepreneurs and business owners nowadays are looking for a highly accessible location with great investment potential. With the new LRT3 in the works, I think The Glenz shows plenty of promise.

## Coming from a Construction Background, Why Did SBC Decide to Venture into the Property Development Market?

We have been in the construction line for a little over two decades now and we have booked more than RM1 billion in revenue. We have no plans on fully halting our construction arm just yet. In fact, we are in the process of building numerous commercial and residential projects for our customers.

With decades of experience, healthy industry connections and a strong portfolio backing us up, we believe that it is the right time for us to venture into the property development industry as this is where the major bulk volume profit is.

We have been patiently preparing ourselves over the last ten years for the right opportunity. Thankfully, patience paid off seven years ago when we came across this freehold commercial land with an excellent address. In fact, I would confidently say not venturing into property development would be an unwise choice for SBC at this point in time.

## What Are the Challenges You Face While Developing This Project?

Despite our preparation, patience and tendency to seize great opportunities, we have entered the property development market at a very challenging time. It is currently a buyer’s market with most major developers working harder to get by.

However, while others see challenges, I see opportunities. These struggles are bringing out the best in our staff here at SBC. Without these external pressures, we wouldn’t have developed a great product that can meet the current high market expectations in terms of design, packaging and presentation.

Despite being in the construction field for two decades, we are now the new kid on the block. Because of that, we need to work twice as hard as other industry players, not just to maintain our current position but to outlast the competition.

After gaining much insight into The Glenz and the story behind the project, Property Insight has asked Mr Fong if there’s anything else he would like to say to his customers directly.

“The Glenz is uniquely designed for your needs, where you can play and work in comfort. The Glenz is a premium development project in a great location that offers greater value. I’d like to thank our existing buyers for their continuous support and faith in us,” Mr Fong said.
