Do they? The short answer is—not really.

Although 5G networks do adopt radio frequency (RF) fields above 6GHz, it is well below the human exposure limits specified by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).

A key fact to consider is that 5G radiation is non-ionizing, unlike X-rays or radioactive materials that can break molecular bonds, which cause cancer and related diseases. However, If RF radiation is absorbed by the body in large quantities, it can produce heat, which leads to tissue damage.

Many studies have been conducted on the effects of high RF energy on the human body, with the effects of heat taken into consideration. None has shown confirmed evidence that low-level RF fields even above 6GHz are hazardous to human health, which is the same statement issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) on its official website.

Citizens can rest assured that there are no consequences to public health, as long as overall exposure remains below international guidelines. WHO is currently conducting a comprehensive health risk assessment, which will be published by 2022. It will also review scientific evidence on the subject matter as more public health-related data become available, and is advocating further research into this area.
