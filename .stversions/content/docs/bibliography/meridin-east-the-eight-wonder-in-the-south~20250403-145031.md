# Meridin East The Eight Wonder In The South

By: Jotham Lim

To escape from the hustle and bustle of the city of Johor Bahru, to avoid the turtling heavy traffic to and from the southern Malaysian border, Johorians may rejoice as there is a new haven in town. The Meridin East township in Pasir Gudang is an all-new, all-exciting project brought to you by Mah Sing Berhad, a project worthy of consideration if you have plans to dig your roots in the southern states.

Spanning over 1,313 acres of freehold land just 30 minutes away from Johor Bahru city centre, Meridin East is a mixed development township project which consists of residential landed properties, condominiums, shop offices and light industrial districts. It is a truly all-in-one township, where one could work, live and grow their families in one space.

Investors targeting the student market would be happy to know that Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL) and University Teknologi MARA (UiTM) are both 15km away. Access to groceries and leisure activities are a stone’s throw away with easy access to the nearby Tesco, Kip Mart, Giant Hypermart, Aeon and Mydin.

If security is one of your primary concerns, be rest assured knowing that the township is gated and guarded, with 24 hours CCTV surveillance and security personnel available around the clock.

Each precinct is designed with parks near their entrance, and plenty of driveway spaces between houses. It bridges the gap between form and functionality, by providing a gathering space and easy accessibility in case of fire emergencies, while still being a pleasant addition to the sustainability of the township as well.

Speaking of sustainability, community living is a priority for the Meridin East township and it has been designed as such. Along with plenty of health facilities spread across the township is a 16 km jogging and cycling path where communities are able to congregate and get to know one another. This is on top of the 9-acre Mulberry Lake and picnic garden near the entrance of the township.

Being able to get in and out of the township easily and quickly is also understandably important as well. Thankfully, there is a new road connecting Tanjung Langsat and Jalan Kong Kong which will shorten the travel time from Tanjung Langsat to Pasir Gudang from the current 45 minutes down to a mere 15 minutes travel time by car. The completed Senai-Desaru Expressway conveniently connects the township to the city as well with minimum traffic congestion.

Meridin East is built with longevity in mind. Their smallest unit on offer has a built-up space of about 1,600 sq ft with a mere starting price of RM390,800–a comfortable size for a young and budding family.

Meanwhile, also on offer are units sized at 2,333 sq ft, which can fulfill the vision of having multiple generations of family living under the same roof.

In this day and age, such a vision is hard to come by, and yet Mah Sing wishes to offer that vision to the marketplace.

All the advantages listed may seem attractive on paper, but the key factor in any property purchase still boils down to pricing and value. According to the data released by the National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) house prices across Malaysia averages about RM400,000.

Potential buyers will be happy to know that property prices in Meridin East do below that amount. To further add on, the Malaysian House Price Index in 2018 shows Johor having a 6.6% growth in house prices, which is a price growth higher than the state of Penang.

Different properties satisfy different needs.
