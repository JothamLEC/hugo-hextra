## Paradise Isle Within The Hustle And Bustle

By: Jotham Lim

“Home is a shelter from storms. All sorts of storms.” -William J. Bennett

Battling the hustle and bustle of living in a metropolis can be very tiring, hence why it is important to choose a home that can serve as an oasis for your daily stresses in life. If you are a young working adult, or have just started a young family, there might be a project that you should be paying attention to.

PROJECT INFO

Located near Bandar Sunway, Greenfield Residences is developed by Cicet Asia Development Sdn Bhd (Cicet Asia). Designed by one of BCI Asia’s Top 10 Architects in Singapore, the resort-inspired project consists of 816 residential suites in three high-rise towers and 23 lifestyle retail shops.

This project is set to be one of the icons of the surrounding area, a landmark of the Sunway Mentari district. At this moment of writing, Tower A is sold out, while the second tower, Tower B, is 85% sold. Tower C was launched earlier this year in April, with a 36-storey development consisting of 297 residential suites.

Greenfield Residence Facade

Unit sizes range from 581 sq ft to 1,302 sq ft, priced from RM535,000 upwards. Units Type D and Type E consist of a dual-key layout, offering much-needed flexibility for both ownstay and investment purposes.

At the ground level, there are 18 lifestyle boutique shops, single-storeyed but double the volume, primed and ready for future extensions. These shops are great for catering to the residents residing on the upper floors, and for young entrepreneurs and startups to grow their business considering the surrounding area.

PARADISE ISLE With limited land space here in Klang Valley and rising land prices, not many development projects dared to put such heavy emphasis on green space. And yet, 48% of the Greenfield Residences estate is covered in lush greenery, putting the “green” in Greenfield. There are two acres of recreational garden space and six thematic landscapes for residents to enjoy, explore and utilise.

Cicet Asia has definitely had the customer journey nailed down to the core for this development project, paying very close attention to the minute details.

Imagine yourself jogging through the premises. The jogging track runs parallel to a dense tree line, providing shade and fresh air for your morning run. You circle a pink blossom park, where family members of all ages are able to enjoy a wonderful flower viewing while having a picnic.

While jogging, you notice that there is a cascading pool running across the entire development, which functions similarly to a river. It provides sounds of streaming water, a soothing ambience while you exercise as you start your day.

If you are someone who is health-conscious and prioritises wellness and well-being, Greenfield Residences is definitely hard to beat in this regard.

EDUCATION HUB Perhaps you are not looking for an own-stay unit, but for an investment vehicle instead. In that regards, how does Greenfield Residences fare?

There is potential for Greenfield Residences to serve as a stable student hostel due to the bustling student activity happening in Bandar Sunway. Nearby educational institutions include Taylor’s University, Sunway University, Monash University and INTI International College, providing a steady influx of students migrating to the area.

I would like to highlight that The One Academy is located just right beside Greenfield Residence, making it a prime location for students studying in the college.

Being within easy travel distance of the education hubs gives property investors the advantage of listing properties up for rent, not just from conventional rental listing platforms, but through student bodies and organisations as well.

DEVELOPER BACKGROUND From the outset, it may be worrisome to see Greenfield Residences being Cicet Asia’s maiden project, but do not let first impressions fools you. Cicet has a construction arm that has already been established since 1991, and they have since worked alongside some of Malaysia’s Top 10 developers.

They have garnered decades of experience with a portfolio of over 50 high-end properties, which includes residential and commercial components as well as public infrastructure, both locally and internationally. Led by an experienced team, its delivery of projects and services of the highest quality has garnered a string of property awards for the Group.

In 2014, Cicet Asia has decided to venture into property development. The group is built on top of four key pillars of strength–“Unity, Innovation, Sincerity and Practicality”, which reflect in the properties they have developed and constructed. At the end of the day, Cicet Asia aims to create excellent, sustainable communities with global standards, with Greenfield Residences being the first breakthrough project to set them on the world’s stage.
