# MTC New Tourism Hotspot?

_By: Jotham Lim_

The Malaysia Tourism City (MTC) was launched on the 3rd of March by the Minister of Tourism and Culture Malaysia, YB Datuk Mohamaddin bin Ketapi, together with Dato Seth Yap, Executive Director of Meridian Berhad.

The flagship project by Meridian will be located at Kuala Linggi, Melaka, and will transform 622.13 acres of land into an integrated tourism destination.

Meridian Berhad has an existing robust portfolio, with Dato’ Seth’s World’s private entity, the Monopoly Mansion and M101 Skywheel, designed by Studio F. A Porsche. They are certainly no strangers to tourism–orientated property development.

Dato’ Seth expressed: “Our ultimate goal for MTC is to increase the arrival of tourists and prolong the overnight stay. With MTC we target to increase another 2 Million tourists arrival and another additional 1.5 Million overnight stay tourists in Melaka, (bringing in) an additional RM5 billion per annum.”

Under his own private entity, M101 Holdings Sdn Bhd, Dato’ Seth has also signed a licensing agreement with Hasbro Live! (Hasbro), the world’s largest toy maker with 1,000 over Intellectual Properties under their belt, with famous brands such as Nerf, My Little Pony and Play-Doh.

With the licensing rights secured, there are plans to develop a World’s First Hasbro Water Theme Park. However, the collaboration framework between Meridian and M101 is still under negotiation and will be announced in due course.
