# Unique Fire Are You Protected?

### An Exclusive Interview With Marcus Liew

By: Jotham Lim

Did you know that more than 65% of all fire accidents in Malaysia actually occur in residential areas? Statistically speaking, children in residential daycare centres are 21 times more likely to get involved in a fire-related incident than their parents working in offices. The areas least prone to fire-related incidents are, surprisingly, petrol stations, with only seven recorded cases in the entirety of 2017 compared to approximately 3,700 cases in residential areas.

Statistics have shown that the residential market is severely underpenetrated, according to the Fire and Safety Department of Malaysia. There is a lack of awareness and education regarding fire safety here in Malaysia, despite major efforts from both the public and private sectors.

I am speaking to Marcus Liew, director of Unique Fire Industry, which happens to be the biggest fire protection equipment factory as recognised by the Malaysian Book of Records. The factory has been producing a wide array of fire safety products, from fire extinguishers and safety signs, all the way to the yellow fire hydrants.

Entrepreneur Insight has the pleasure of conducting an exclusive interview with Marcus to better understand the problems in the industry and how Unique Fire plays a “unique” role in solving said issues.

## Why Are Residential Areas More Susceptible to Fire-related Incidents?

Electrical fires are the leading cause of fires in residential areas, accounting for more than half of all incidents. Most extension cords and multi-plug adapters on the market are actually only meant for temporary use. Yet, it is common to see five or six plugs connected to a single power point in a typical household, especially near the television and cable set.

Compounded with the fact that they are plugged in and switched on permanently, this will severely heat up the electrical wiring hidden within the walls and ceiling. Most electrical wiring comes with a limited lifespan and will deteriorate over time. When the wires lose their outer protective layer, the heated wire will start to produce smoke, catching nearby furniture and curtains on fire, which will eventually spread and engulf the entire home.

This is not a major issue for commercial buildings and vehicles as they have to strictly adhere to the fire requirements under the Uniform Building By-Law (UBBL 1984). Not to mention designated buildings are also required to have an annual fire safety inspection under the Fire Services Act 1988.

Thankfully, our government has implemented guidelines to have mandatory smoke detectors pre-installed in newly developed residential housing, which is a step in the right direction. However, the properties most susceptible to incidents are old projects dating back more than 20 years. There hasn’t been any policy addressing this issue yet.

Fire safety is definitely no joke. Many lives have been lost to these unfortunate related mishaps. A University of Malaya study estimates that fires cause an average of RM27 million worth of property damage per incident in Selangor. You may think you are invulnerable, but you are not.

## Where Does Your Company Fit into the Picture in Addressing These Problems?

Unique Fire manufactures products that help save precious lives and properties during fire-related incidents. For example, a smoke alarm serves as the first warning when a potential threat is detected, allowing occupants to escape before it is too late. Fire extinguishers act as the first response in the event before local authorities arrive.

When a fire gets out of control, personal safety becomes the utmost priority. However, there is a chance that a blackout may occur, making escaping in the dark fairly difficult and dangerous. This is where escape signs play an important role in directing people away from danger and towards safety.

Fire safety awareness and prevention are always overlooked by the majority of the public. Hence, I have set up a brand new department in the company that primarily focuses on creating and building awareness amongst the public regarding the basics. We will be conducting many seminars, talks, and programmes to share our knowledge, hoping that people take appropriate action and preventive measures to safeguard their own lives and investments. All parties are responsible, including the people themselves, and we hope to minimise occurrences or at least reduce the fatalities incurred.

## Are there Any case Studies You Can Share whereby Your company’s Product Has Helped save Lives?

Back in 2011, there was a gas explosion at the Empire Shopping Gallery in Subang Jaya in the early hours of the morning. The sprinkler system we supplied kicked in as intended during the catastrophe, minimising any potential losses. Only four people were injured, and there were no fatalities involved. The building was left standing and is still currently operational.

It is times like these where we get tremendous joy from our work. It is easy to get caught up in the manufacturing process and logistics of running a business and forget how the product is actually being used. When we take a step back and realise that hundreds of millions of dollars were saved because of our efforts, it really becomes a motivational booster.

## What Makes Your Company Unique from Any other Manufacturer?

We offer a broad and comprehensive range of products at competitive prices without sacrificing quality whatsoever, thanks to our streamlined manufacturing process. We are also an authorised distributor of several well-known international brand names such as Kiddie Systems and Viking Corporation.

Fire regulations and design specifications differ from country to country, and we comply even with the most stringent international guidelines. We practice constant in-house quality control and assurance, and we maintain sufficient inventory levels to ensure a relatively short lead time upon order placement. Customers can rest assured that their orders will be delivered on time.

We were fortunate to start trading prior to dabbling into manufacturing. Doing so allowed us to have the financial capability and resources to sustain our growth when we decided to make the conversion, unlike many other factories that seem to be struggling. Understanding market demands and delivering the right product to the right customers is something we take great pride in.

## Where is Your Product Currently Being Used Right Now?

Our products are shipped, delivered, and outfitted nationwide, including in several ASEAN countries as well. Here are some of our major clients in recent history:

- KVMRT Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line
- Genting Highlands
- Legoland Malaysia
- Midvalley Megamall
- Empire Shopping Gallery Subang
- Starling Mall
- KLIA 2
- TNB Substations
- Coca Cola Bottlers Malaysia
- Bahru Stainless Sdn Bhd
- Hilton KL
- Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur
- Help International School
- Taylor’s International School

As you can see, most governmental, commercial, and industrial properties outfitted with the necessary equipment are considered well-protected against fires. The same cannot be said for residential areas, and we are working towards addressing this issue.

## Are there Any New and Exciting Products or Services Your Company is Releasing soon that We Should Look forward To?

We are in the midst of launching a new line dubbed “Design Extinguisher” to promote usage and purchases for homes. Using state-of-the-art technology, customers will be able to customise their own print designs instead of the standard red we are accustomed to. This is excellent news for homeowners who pay a lot of attention to interior designing. Custom-designed extinguishers help blend aesthetics with practicality, adding a little spice to the home while protecting life. Having a function as a decoration makes it easier to place in the open for easy access when needed. Custom-designed extinguishers might sound expensive at first, but our pricing is quite affordable to encourage widespread adoption. That is the core concept behind this launch, as we hope homeowners will be incentivised to equip their homes with the necessary equipment properly, something that has never been done before in history.

We are dabbling in B2C on top of B2B, and it is a risk worth taking. We have consulted to ensure that the design complies with regulations, and the custom print is only for private use. We are wary of this addition.

Our newly opened department focused on building awareness recently participated in an initiative organised by Management Science University and Universiti Teknologi MARA called the “Largest Simultaneous Participation in a Children’s Fire Drill Event” for a Malaysia Book of Records attempt. This was in response to the rise in cases involving young children, especially in tahfiz schools and private residences in particular, who are unable to protect themselves during emergencies. Hence, there is a need to educate them early, from a young age, on the proper protocols during a crisis.

## What Would You Say Are the Core Fundamentals of Your Success?

Without a doubt, employees are the backbone of the entire business. Without their support and commitment, we wouldn’t have accomplished what we have today. When hiring, apart from body language and working attitude, passion is a crucial recruitment criterion. A candidate’s ability to solve day-to-day problems and present challenges commonly faced at work determines their employability. Handling and addressing problems is relatively simple, and I believe companies should adopt this approach.

Running a company is never an easy task, and it is common to lose sight of objectives during the process. When in doubt, we refer to our core business values as follows:

- Integrity
- Loyalty, Trust, and Respect
- Teamwork
- Passion for Customers
- Striving for Excellence
- Innovation

These core values are essential in keeping everyone on the same page while serving under the same banner and striving towards a common goal. Their importance is understated and generally overlooked by many companies.

## What is the Riskiest Move You Have Made as an Entrepreneur?

One of the intense struggles in recent years was managing to secure an order to supply suppression systems for underground stations on the MRT Line One, in the context of Chemetron Systems as contracted distributors. Initially, we were ecstatic to be involved in Klang Valley’s megaprojects, as it was a significant milestone. However, we were informed at the last minute about the unification between Kiddie and Chemetron. This was no longer classified information and jeopardised our profile, and there was a chance we would be denied the right to supply the equipment to the people behind the MRT project. Staying true, we notified the relevant parties accordingly. Thankfully, the decision paid off, and we managed to secure an agreement that allowed the terms and conditions to remain intact. Being honest, trusting, and understanding was definitely the right call to make.

## What is the Market Outlook and Your Future Aspirations Moving Forward?

With the advancement of technology, I believe the Internet of Things (IoT) will soon make huge waves in terms of educating and integration. We are fortunate to live in a country free from most forms of natural disasters, but this should not lead to a complacent approach towards general safety, especially towards hazards prevention and awareness. Seeing how new social media can help solve problems, intricately connecting people with one another, reaching out, and organising talk shows and seminars has never been easier. This will definitely help in building awareness, and our goal is to pioneer this advancement.

We are now in the midst of discussing with several business partners, and R&D efforts are currently underway to further improve design and effectiveness while focusing on streamlining the manufacturing process. Speaking to you gives me insight into the importance we play in resolving this nationwide epidemic. As the interview comes to an end, I would like to convey to the public: you live only once, so make every moment count. Protect your loved ones from dangers and never forget that Unique Fire Industry is here to be ‘Your Guard Against Fire’.
