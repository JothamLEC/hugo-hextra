## Being An Early Adopter is not Objectively “Better”

*Summary*
- When mobile phones first hit the market, everyone knew that the technology would be revolutionary. Early developers quickly learnt to build software for Nokia or Sony Ericsson devices, each having peculiar intricacies unique to their platforms.
- It was when the iPhone and the App Store launched that started an industry-wide standardisation. By then, the efforts of early adopters had gone to waste, and they’d trained themselves into a biased way of development — especially when they’d done so early in their careers.
- To survive, these developers either had to unlearn and relearn a new paradigm of doing things, or bet on the platforms they had come to know and love.
- It is safe to say that iOS and Android are the two remaining platforms that are relevant. Newer mobile developers have had an easier time navigating this consumer landscape.

## Linear is Totally Viable for a Marketing Department

*2025-03-20*

- Linear is best known to help product builders and software development teams keep track of projects and sprint cycles.
    - Conceptually, an evergreen campaign/company website is not that different from a product.
    - Both require constant upkeep and improvement.
- Why this benefits my team:
    - It helps the team move away from deadlines to sprint cycles.
    - We already operate in a similar workflow via Notion. This is a more refined variant.
    - Effort estimates and completion rates are better KPI proxies than gut feelings.
    - Helps the team better understand DevOps. I’ve been nudging them to learn more about the *tech* in tech marketing rather than the *marketing* part.
    - Potentially integrate go-to-market strategy as part of the company’s product development cycle (they’re using Jira).
- The team appears to be either curious or apathetic — but it’s better than negativity.

## [Octopus.do](https://octopus.do) — Free Sitemap Builder

*2025-03-20*

Innov8tif is going through a new website revamp, and frankly, I’d assume that we’ll be using something like Excalidraw or Draw.io. I wasn’t looking forward to using such systems, because they’re clunky and hard to replicate/amend. My teammate came across this solution, and it’s pretty crazy what you can do with it — it’s functionally a wireframing tool!
